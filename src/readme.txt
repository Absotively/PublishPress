PublishPress is essential for WordPress sites with multiple writers. Get editorial calendars, pre-publish checklists, content workflows and much more.

== Description ==

Do you run a busy WordPress site? If your WordPress site has more than one content creator, then you need PublishPress.

PublishPress is the essential plugin for any WordPress site with multiple writers.

PublishPress is a plugin with several tools that help your team stay organized:

* Use the [Editorial Calendar](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/calendar/) and [Content Overview](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/calendar/) to get a clear picture of all your planned and published content.
* You can create [Comments](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/editorial-comments/) and [Notifications](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/notifications/) to leave feedback and keep your team in the loop.
* You can add [Metadata](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/editorial-metadata/) to give your team extra information about each post.
* Create [Custom Statuses](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/custom-statuses/) so that WordPress matches your team’s workflow.

= WORDPRESS PRE-PUBLISHING CHECKLIST =

The “Content Checklist” add-on is perfect for anyone who wants to create a consistent experience with their WordPress content. If you publish a lot of content, it can be hard to make sure every post has the features you need. Using the PublishPress Content Checklist, you can define tasks that must be complete before content is published. Next to every post and page, writers see a checklist box, showing the tasks they need to complete.

= WHO SHOULD USE PUBLISHPRESS? =

PublishPress is ideal for WordPress sites that have content teams. With PublishPress, you can collaborate muchmore effectively. This makes PublishPress a great solution for any site with multiple users. PublishPress is often used by companies and non-profits, universities and schools, plus by magazines, newspapers and blogs.

= EDITORIAL CONTENT CALENDAR =

The calendar gives you a powerful overview of your publishing schedule. Using the Editorial Calendar, you can easily see when content is planned, and when it was published. You can also drag-and-drop content to a new publication date. By default, you see all the WordPress content you have planned for the next six weeks. If you need to drill down, you can filter the calendar by post status, categories, users or post types.

= CONTENT OVERVIEW =

The Content Overview screen is a companion to the Calendar screen. Whereas the Calendar allows you to see content organized by dates, Content Overview allows you to drill down and see content organized by status, categories, or users. In the top-right corner is a “Print” button. Click this to get a printable overview of all your planned content.

= CUSTOM STATUSES =

This feature allows you to create custom post statuses such as “In Progress” or “Pending Review”. You can define statuses to match the stages of your team’s publishing workflow.

By default, WordPress provides you with a very limited set of status choices: Draft and Pending Review. With PublishPress you’ll see a much wider range of options. When you first install PublishPress, you’ll see these extra statuses: Pitch, Assigned, and In Progress. You can then create more custom post statuses to define the stages of your publishing workflow.

= EDITORIAL COMMENTS =

A very important feature in PublishPress is commenting. You can leave comments under each post you write. This is a private conversation between writers and editors and allows you to discuss what needs to be changed before publication.

* [Click here for more on PublishPress Editorial Comments](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/editorial-comments/)

= EDITORIAL METADATA =

Metadata enabled you to keep track of important requirements for your content. This feature allows you to create fields and store information about content items.

By default, PublishPress provide 4 examples of metadata, but you can add your own to meet your team’s needs.

* [Click here for more on PublishPress Editorial Metadata](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/editorial-metadata/)

= EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS =

Notifications keep you and your team up to date on changes to important content. Users can be subscribed to notifications for any post, either individually or by selecting user groups. You can quickly search through all your users to find the desired name or email address, or display just those users already subscribed to a post.

* [Click here for more on PublishPress EMail Notifications ](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/notifications/)

= USER GROUPS =

For larger organizations with many people involved in the publishing process, user groups help keep your workflow organized and informed.

To find the user settings, go to the PublishPress link in your WordPress admin area, and click the “User Groups” tab. By default, PublishPress provides four user groups: Copy Editors, Photographers, Reporters and Section Editors.

Currently, the most important user of user groups is [Email Notifications](http://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/notifications/), but we intend to expand the capabilities of user groups in future PublishPress releases.
