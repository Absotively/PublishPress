= EDITORIAL CONTENT CALENDAR =

The calendar gives you a powerful overview of your publishing schedule. Using the Editorial Calendar, you can easily see when content is planned, and when it was published. You can also drag-and-drop content to a new publication date. By default, you see all the WordPress content you have planned for the next six weeks. If you need to drill down, you can filter the calendar by post status, categories, users or post types.

= NOTIFICATION WORKFLOWS =

Notifications keep you and your team up to date on changes to important content. Users can be subscribed to notifications for any post, either individually or by selecting user groups. PublishPress allows you to create powerful notification workflows based on post types, categories, status changes and much more.

* [Click here for more on PublishPress Notifications](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/notifications/)

= CONTENT OVERVIEW =

The Content Overview screen is a companion to the Calendar screen. Whereas the Calendar allows you to see content organized by dates, Content Overview allows you to drill down and see content organized by status, categories, or users. In the top-right corner is a “Print” button. Click this to get a printable overview of all your planned content.

* [Click here for more on the PublishPress Content Overview](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/content-overview/)

= CUSTOM STATUSES =

This feature allows you to create custom post statuses such as “In Progress” or “Pending Review”. You can define statuses to match the stages of your team’s publishing workflow.

By default, WordPress provides you with a very limited set of status choices: Draft and Pending Review. With PublishPress you’ll see a much wider range of options. When you first install PublishPress, you’ll see these extra statuses: Pitch, Assigned, and In Progress. You can then create more custom post statuses to define the stages of your publishing workflow.

* [Click here for more on the PublishPress Custom Statuses](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/custom-statuses/)

= EDITORIAL COMMENTS =

A very important feature in PublishPress is commenting. You can leave comments under each post you write. This is a private conversation between writers and editors and allows you to discuss what needs to be changed before publication.

* [Click here for more on PublishPress Editorial Comments](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/editorial-comments/)

= EDITORIAL METADATA =

Metadata enabled you to keep track of important requirements for your content. This feature allows you to create fields and store information about content items.

By default, PublishPress provide 4 examples of metadata, but you can add your own to meet your team’s needs.

* [Click here for more on PublishPress Editorial Metadata](https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/editorial-metadata/)

= USER GROUPS =

For larger organizations with many people involved in the publishing process, user groups help keep your workflow organized and informed.

To find the user settings, go to the PublishPress link in your WordPress admin area, and click the “User Groups” tab. By default, PublishPress provides four user groups: Copy Editors, Photographers, Reporters and Section Editors.

Currently, the most important user of user groups is [Email Notifications](http://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/notifications/), but we intend to expand the capabilities of user groups in future PublishPress releases.

= IMPORTING FROM EDITFLOW =

PublishPress is based on the EditFlow plugin. It is easy for Edit Flow users to import your data and settings.
